 SHRI Anandpur Trust </center> </h2>

<p> SHRI PARAMHANS ADVAIT MATH made its advent over a hundred years ago to spread and preach Truth,
    ideals of Bhakti, Karam-Yoga, and spiritual knowledge. It was founded by the First Great Master, 
    the Prophet of the age, PARAMHANS SHRI SHRI 108 SHRI SWAMI ADVAIT ANANDJI MAHARAJ, Sanyasi Puri 
    born in 1846 A.D<br>

    spiritual upliftment of the 
    common masses. This holy mission was successfully carried out by his Sanyasi successors and is 
    fastly moving towards its goal by bestowing lasting peace of mind and tranquility to the makind 
    and promoting universal brotherhood, so essential in this age of greed and selfishness. Selfless 
    service to the mankind is the motto of this Trust. The present FIFTH MASTER, SHRI SHRI 108 SHRI 
    SWAMI DARSHAN PURAN ANANDJI MAHARAJ JI OF THE SAMPRADAYA, has accelerated the pace of promotion 
    of spiritual knowledge and selfless service.<br>

     Shri Anandpur Trust, established in 1954, is located at P.O.Shri Anandpur near Esagarh, Distt. 
        Ashoknagar (MP), is an embodiment of spirituality, social services, truth and love and it adorns
         the State of Madhya Pradesh by its precious higher ideals taught by our Rishis of ancient past.
          All these activities are in furtherance of the mission of Shri Paramhans Advait Mat for bestowing
           peace, love and joy in the lives of suffering humanity through thousands of Sadhus, Sanyasis and 
           selfless workers.<br>
 This Trust has always done its duty towards the nation and risen to the occasion whenever
        emergencies and natural calamities demanded. The Trust has been contributing to the PM’s
         Relief Fund and Madhya Pradesh CM’s Relief Fund quite liberally. The Trust has also been 
         assisting various Social and Relief Institutions in MP as also in other States for 
         promotion of social causes for the benefit of the general masses. The Trust, being secular
          in its approach, is also engaged in carring out humanitarian services in the field of education
           and medical aid by instituting schools, charitable dispensaries and hospitals, where free 
           medical and surgical treatment is imparted to a large number of poor and needy patients 
           irrespective of caste, creed and religion.</p></div></div>
